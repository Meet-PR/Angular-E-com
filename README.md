🖥️ Usage





Link Dependencies in index.html: Make sure your index.html includes the local Bootstrap and Font Awesome files. Add these lines inside the <head> tag:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css">

And these scripts before the closing </body> tag:

<script src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/@popperjs/core/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

Note: You’ll need to install jquery and @popperjs/core as additional dependencies for Bootstrap to work:

npm install jquery @popperjs/core



Run the local server: Start the server to serve the static files:

npx http-server . -p 8080

This will serve the project on http://localhost:8080.



Open in your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to view the website! 🌟

🛠️ Customization





Add Images: Replace the empty src="" attributes in <img> tags with your image paths.



Dynamic Data: Integrate Angular or another framework to make the product listings dynamic.



Styling: Add custom CSS in a separate file to tweak Bootstrap styles.

📝 Notes





The project is static and doesn’t include backend functionality (e.g., cart, checkout). You can extend it with a backend like Node.js or Firebase! 🔥



Since dependencies are now local, you don’t need an internet connection to load Bootstrap or Font Awesome.
